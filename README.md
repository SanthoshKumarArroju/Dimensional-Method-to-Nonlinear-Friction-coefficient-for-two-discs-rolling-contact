# Dimensional-Method-to-Nonlinear-Friction-coefficient-for-two-discs-rolling-contact
Friction can cause energy loss and create unwanted heat, deformation. In the class room and in laboratory friction coefficient is considered as a constant value but, in the real-world friction is nonlinear in nature. 
Mainly it depends up on the dependent forces, ambient conditions and profile of the specimen. 
The study is to get the friction coefficient relations, for number of linearly independent parameters called Power products. 
Select the linearly independent parameters, mechanical properties and external forces for the discs with rolling contact. 
There are ten independent parameters with similarity quantities are set as power product quantities. 
The basic linear dependent parameters are chosen from one of the paper listed in the survey. 
The analysis can be simplified, for two discs with rolling contact and can be extended to gear mechanism. 
The Dimensional Analysis, similarity technique Buckingham Ï€ theorem was used to get the non-dimensional friction coefficient relation.
